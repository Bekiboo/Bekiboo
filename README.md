## Hi, I'm Julien Connault, French Junior Web Developer. 

I graduated Magna Cum Laude (3.96 GPA) from Brigham Young Idaho with a Bachelor of Applied Science, majoring in Web Development. 
I have been an early adopter of Svelte and Sveltekit (since Svelte 2.0), and even though this is my framework of choice, I have also devoted time to learn Angular and React/Next.js, in order to be more competitive on the marketplace.
Iâ€™ve honed my skills by working in small, dynamic teams where close collaboration and adaptability are essential. I am eager to bring this hands-on experience to an established company, contributing to impactful, scalable projects and delivering high-quality code that enhances user experiences.

I'm a Software Engineer and a [builder][isfullstackreal] focused on creating user-friendly experiences  for the web. Feel free to hit me up on discord [@sanctus_omnus](https://discord.com/users/596300182317170709)
