Hi, I'm Julien Connault, French Junior Web Developer. 

I studied in Brigham Young University - Idaho with their online program. 
During my studies I developed a keen interest for two frameworks with very different philosophies: the new and light Svelte/Sveltekit, and the well established but heavier Angular.

I'd like to keep working with both frameworks for more flexibility, depending on the project.
