## Hi, I'm Julien Connault, French Junior Web Developer. 

I studied in Brigham Young University - Idaho with their online program. 
During my studies I developed a keen interest for two frameworks with very different philosophies: the new and light Svelte/Sveltekit, and the well established but heavier Angular.
I have a passion for learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies, and I love working in a team.


I'm a Software Engineer and a [builder][isfullstackreal] focused on creating user-friendly experiences  for the web. Feel free to hit me up on discord [@sanctus_omnus](https://discord.com/users/596300182317170709)
