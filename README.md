# Hi, I'm Julien Connault — French Full-Stack Web Developer

I am a **Svelte & SvelteKit expert** (since Svelte 2.0), also proficient in **React, Angular, Vue, Next.js & NestJS**, building **modern, maintainable web applications** from front to back.

I graduated **Magna Cum Laude (3.96 GPA)** from Brigham Young Idaho with a **Bachelor of Applied Science in Web Development**, and I have honed my skills working in **small, dynamic teams** where collaboration and adaptability are key.

Currently, I am a **full-stack developer** for **Ensombl**, working with **Svelte 5** and **NestJS**, and I also lead **tech initiatives** at the **Elevatus Foundation**, fighting child labor in Madagascar and using technology to create real social impact.

I love turning ideas into **user-friendly, scalable applications** that deliver tangible results.
